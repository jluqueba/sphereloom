"""Pass only once Copilot has reviewed the head commit of a pull request.

Why this exists
---------------

Copilot code review runs on every push to a pull request, but its check run is not part of
the pull request's status rollup, so the branch ruleset cannot require it: a required
check with that name would stay "expected" forever. Without a gate, a pull request shows
as mergeable while the review of its latest commit is still running.

The `copilot-review-gate` workflow runs this script on every push and on every submitted
review. It passes when a Copilot review of the current head commit exists, and otherwise
polls until one appears or a deadline passes. Combined with the ruleset rule that every
review conversation is resolved, a pull request becomes mergeable only after Copilot has
reviewed its latest commit and every finding has been answered.

What it does not do
-------------------

* It does not read the review's findings. A review with open findings passes; resolving
  their threads is enforced by the ruleset.
* It fails closed. Anything it cannot read or understand is a failure, never a pass.
* Pull requests opened by Dependabot pass without a review. The author of a pull request
  cannot be impersonated, and only maintainers can push to a Dependabot branch.

Usage
-----

Run by `.github/workflows/copilot-review-gate.yml`, which supplies the environment variables
read by `load_config`. It uses only the standard library, so CI installs nothing.
